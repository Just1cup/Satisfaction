#MCBH - Satisfaction Survey Form
Description
This project is a Satisfaction Survey Form created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is designed for the fictional company MCBH and aims to collect user feedback on their service. It includes essential form validation features, interactive animations, and a clean, modern design to enhance user experience.

Key Features:
HTML Structure: The form collects basic information, including the user's name, email, satisfaction level, and optional comments.

CSS Styling: Uses a modern color palette with shades of purple and black to give a techy, futuristic vibe.

JavaScript Validation: Form validation ensures that all mandatory fields are filled out before submission. If any fields are missing, the page will scroll to the top, and the fields will be highlighted with red borders.

User Feedback: If any error is detected, a red warning message appears under the respective field, and the page "shakes" for emphasis.

What I Attempted to Do
The goal of this project was to:

Create a responsive and user-friendly satisfaction survey form.

Implement field validation to ensure all required fields are filled before submitting the form.

Provide real-time feedback to the user when they try to submit an incomplete form.

Use a modern, visually appealing design with animations for better interaction.

Technologies Used:
HTML for the structure of the form.

CSS for styling and layout.

JavaScript for form validation and dynamic page interaction.

Future Goals
As this project progresses, I plan to:

Improve the form's design with more advanced animations and responsive elements for mobile devices.

Enhance form validation by integrating advanced features like email validation or password strength meters.

Store user responses in a database or integrate it with back-end technologies (e.g., Node.js or PHP) for future analysis.

Add more interactive elements, such as rating scales or image sliders, to gather more detailed feedback.
